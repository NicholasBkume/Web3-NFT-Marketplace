## Deploying the Web3 App
To deploy OpenD on the Internet Computer blockchain, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Authenticate with Internet Computer
```sh
dfx identity new <your-identity-name>
dfx identity use <your-identity-name>
```

### Step 2: Deploy to the Internet Computer
```sh
dfx deploy --network ic
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
After deployment, you will receive a URL where your application is hosted on the Internet Computer. Open the URL in your browser to access your live app.

### Optional: Deploy on Fleek
You can also deploy OpenD using [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) for IPFS and Internet Computer hosting.
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Fleek.
2. Choose **Internet Computer** as the deployment option.
3. Set up environment variables if needed.
4. Deploy the project and get your live URL.
